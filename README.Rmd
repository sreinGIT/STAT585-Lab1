Our GitHub repository for this lab is https://github.com/sreinGIT/STAT585-Lab1.git.

## Build a Book
The last word in chapter 15 is pseudo-class. 

The biggest problem that we encountered was an error that occured when the index.Rmd file tried to compile line 783 of Conditions.Rmd. The error was

> Execution halted Error in Rscript_render(f, render_args, render_meta) : Failed to compile Conditions.Rmd Calls: <Anonymous> ... render_book -> render_new_session -> Rscript_render Execution halted

We tried Googling the error but were unable to find helpful fixes. In the end, we added "error = TRUE" to the header of that code chunk so that the file would continue to compile despite the error.

## More Weather Data
```{r, include=FALSE}
# Url of FTP site and name of gz file to download
URL      <- "ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ushcn/v2.5/ushcn.tavg.latest.raw.tar.gz"
# Name of gz file. If no folder is specified, the file will be saved in the working directory.
destfile <- "ushcn.tavg.latest.raw.tar.gz"
download.file(URL, destfile)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Create a folder called TavgLatestRaw. The gz file will be unzipped in this folder.
TavgLatestRawFolder <- "TavgLatestRaw"
dir.create(TavgLatestRawFolder, showWarnings=FALSE)

# Unzip the gz file. This will create a folder "ushcn something-something" within the TavgLatestRaw folder. This newest folder will contains the unzipped files.
untar("ushcn.tavg.latest.raw.tar.gz", exdir=TavgLatestRawFolder) 

# Get the name of the new folder "ushcn something-something"
UnzippedFolder <- list.files(TavgLatestRawFolder)

# Change the working directory to the folder TavgLatestRaw
setwd(TavgLatestRawFolder)

# read file names of the unzipped files in "ushcn something-something"
files <-dir(UnzippedFolder)

# count the number of files 
numfiles <- length(files)
```
The file ushcn.tavg.latest.raw.tar.gz downloaded from ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ushcn/v2.5  contains `r numfiles` files.
